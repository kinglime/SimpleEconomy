SimpleEconomy
======

A simple and lightweight economy plugin. I designed this plugin for use on my server because I wanted a plugin I could drag and drop without hours of configuration.

* [Download Latest Stable Build]()

Features
------------
* Two simple commands
* Light weight.
* Minimal configuration or simply drag and drop.

Permission Node(s)
----------------------------
SimpleEconomy uses two permission nodes.

* **`simpleeconomy.money`** - Allows players to use the /money command to check their balance.

* **`simpleeconomy.pay`** - Allows players to use the /pay command to send money to other players.

Command(s)
------------------
Simpleeconomy uses two commands.

* **`/money`** - Shows your balance. (Player command only.)

* **`/pay [player] [amount]`** - Sends money from your account to another player's account. (Player command only.)

**Note:** You do not have to type the [player]'s full name, you can simply type the beginning portion of their name and the plugin will complete it for you.

### Alias(es)

* **`/m`** - Alias for /money

* **`/p`** - Alias for /pay
